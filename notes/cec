cec-client -l
echo 'scan' | cec-client RPI -s -d 1

# turn off the tv
echo "standby 0" | cec-client RPI -s -d 1

# turn on the tv
echo "on 0" | cec-client RPI -s -d 1

# it looks like you can use this to switch the active source to *any* connected
# cec device, but not to a connected non-cec device
