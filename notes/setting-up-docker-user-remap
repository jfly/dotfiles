Following https://medium.com/@frntn/not-your-grandmother-s-docker-environment-c3c5c1a5aab

First, I added `--userns-remap=jeremy"` to /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf:

```
âžœ  /tmp cat /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -s overlay2 --userns-remap=jeremy
```

I added `jeremy:1000:65536` to /etc/subgid and /etc/subuid

After trying out docker buildkit for the first time, i ran into some permission issues. I reverted the above and then followed this set of instructions, and things seem better: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39866#issuecomment-646629641
