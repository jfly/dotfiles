I'm streaming to a Mac from windows. I was running DS4 windows on the host machine but the game (Wasteland 3) still recognized the controller as a DS4 and wants me to use the touchpad to open the inventory menu. Theres no way to remap the buttons in the game. Suggestions?

nothing I can suggest you on mac, the touchpad isn't used on parsec
if the guest was on windows, you could at least use ds4windows to remap the touchpad to something
ds4windows on the host won't do anything if the controller isn't directly on the host
oh you should keep settings > host > virtual gamepad type as xbox 360
if you don't want the game to see it as dualshock 4

hm alright I'll give that a shot
that did in fact solve the issue. disappointing that the touchpad cant be used but oh well

vigem, which parsec uses, doesn't have that yet iirc
