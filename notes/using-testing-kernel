(cribbed together from the instructions on https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id%3D89395&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1580578751069000&usg=AFQjCNHcbUAlL6vdhn0aPLD8GcXThIV1Zg)

1. Uncomment two lines for the testing repo in /etc/pacman.conf
2. sudo pacman -Sy virtualbox-host-dkms linux linux-headers linux-api-headers linux-firmware
   - Note:
     https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/downgrading_packages#Downgrading_the_kernel
     says to downgrade any kernel modules. In the example, they give
     virtualbox-host-modules-arch, which I do not have installed (I *do* have
     `virtualbox-host-dkms`, though...). I tried querying for all packages that
     provide modules using `pacman -Ql | grep /usr/lib/modules/ | awk '{print $1}' |
     sort -u`, but that didn't show any virtual box stuff...
     Oooh, maybe try looking at `pacman -Ql | grep /usr/lib/modules-load.d` instead.
   - Note: Not sure if `linux-api-headers` and `linux-firmware` should be in
     the list, but it feels like it can't hurt?
3. Comment the testing repo out again in /etc/pacman.conf
4. `pacman -Syy`
5. Now, `pacman -Syuu` will want to downgrade those packages. You can add them
   to `IgnorePkg` if you want, but maybe first reboot to confirm that things
   aren't totally broken.
