    Unfortunately, this is not quite enough to get a fresh Kodi bootstrapped:
    The problem is that these sources get added, but they won't get scraped
    until they have content types, and there's apparently no good way to *set*
    the content type except via the Kodi UI, and the values end up stored in the
    db? It's hard to find a clear
    conversation about this online, see
    https://www.reddit.com/r/kodi/comments/64plwy/comment/dg445ne/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
    for the least confused comment I can find about it.

    There's probably something clever we can do instead. Some wild ideas:
    - do something at the SQL level: bootstrap with an actual db dump, or tweak
      a fresh db Just Enough to get it working?
    - find (or build) an API to set the content type of these sources?
    - expand this xml format to have attributes for content type that kodi can
      understand?
