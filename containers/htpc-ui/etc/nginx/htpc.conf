# Some hackiness to get Kodi's Chorus2's web ui working with websockets.
# The UI is hardcoded to use port 9090 for websockets:
#  https://github.com/xbmc/chorus2/blob/f9f376930fd544e86b1dd3c0dc5f8999031d73c5/src/js/app.coffee#L8
# However, we can't just blindly forward incoming connections on 9090 to Kodi,
# because we need to terminate the incoming ssl (wss://) connection. We can't
# listen on 9090 (because Chorus2 is already listening there), so instead we
# listen on 9092, and configure our router to forward external connections to
# port 9090 to port 9092 (http://router.asus.com/Advanced_VirtualServer_Content.asp).
# Ridiculous.
# I really don't think it should be this difficult. I don't understand why a separate port is even necessary.
# Hopefully a better solution shows up on https://github.com/xbmc/chorus2/issues/133 someday.
